# Add as Search engine

## Firefox ðŸ¦Š

On Firefox you have to enable the ability to add custom search engines.
1. Go to `about:config`.
2. Search for the flag `browser.urlbar.update2.engineAliasRefresh` and set it to `true`.
3. Go to `about:preferences#search`, scroll down and click on `Add`.
4. In the Menu add a name, does not matter what is is.
5. In the second field add the link that is shown on the [website](https://unduck.heggli.dev). (If you deploy it by yourself then just go on your website instead if clicking the link)
6. Click on `Save`
7. Now scroll back up where you can select your default search engine and select the one with the name that you have given it previously.
8. The search engine is now setup and ready to use.
